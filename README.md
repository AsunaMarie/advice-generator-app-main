## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I learned about fetch.
A function that is useful for doing API calls.
```js
const getAdvice = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.adviceslip.com/advice?t=' + Math.random())
    const advice = await response.json()
    
    return advice
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Using the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) - It helped me use the Fetch API to do API calls.
